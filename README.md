Assignment 3: Sophia John - 

## Daily Journal
This project is a website where you are able to journal as often as you want. You are able to add, delete, and modify entries as well as display them. Based on how motivated or happy you are the website will calculate whether you had a good day or not.

There are four inputs for the user: the date, an entry, a rating from 1-5 of how happy you are, and a rating from a 1-5 of how motivated you are. To delete an entry enter in a date and all entries from that date will be deleted. To show all journal entries press "Display Journal Entries."

Some challenges I faced was with Express, learning how to work with mongodb and implementing the update feature. 

In this project I changed my css to align with Pico. I was able to implement dark mode using some code Pico provided. 

### Design
I made my site more accessible by providing Dark Mode for those who have eye conditions or migraines to reduce eye strain and headaches.
