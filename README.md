## Daily Journal
This project is a website where you are able to journal as often as you want. You are able to add, delete, and modify entries as well as display them. Based on how motivated or happy you are the website will calculate whether you had a good day or not.

When running this project make sure to preview it in a new window.

There are four inputs for the user: the date, an entry, a rating from 1-5 of how happy you are, and a rating from a 1-5 of how motivated you are. To delete an entry enter in a date and all entries from that date will be deleted. To show all journal entries press "Display Journal Entries." To update an entry click update and update any values in the entry - you MUST put in the id in order for an entry to udpate.

Some challenges I faced was with Express, learning how to work with mongodb and implementing the update feature. I also had some trouble with Glitch. My dark mode for some reason doesn't always work and it takes time for glitch to process/render. Additionally my web page only works if I preview it in a new window from glitch.

In this project I changed my css to align with Pico. I was able to implement dark mode using some code Pico provided. 

### Design
Achievement 1:
I made my site more accessible by encorporating Dark Mode for those who have eye conditions or migraines to reduce eye strain and headaches. 

Achievement 2: 
Contrast: I utilized contrast effectively by distinguishing between the text boxes and their backgrounds, ensuring readability for users in both dark and light modes. This enhances accessibility and usability across different viewing preferences. Additionally, I applied contrast to buttons for submission, deletion, updates, and display.

Repititon: Consistency was a major focus, as I repeated the formatting across buttons and titles throughout the site. Colors like black, white, and blue were used consistently to create a cohesive visual theme. This repetition helped unify the design.

Alignment: To achieve a clean and organized layout, I aligned all buttons precisely, centering them to draw attention and emphasize their importance.

Proximity: I grouped similar elements, such as buttons, closely together, maintaining uniform color and formatting to indicate their related functions. This use of proximity organizes the interface logically, allowing users to understand the relationship between different elements.
